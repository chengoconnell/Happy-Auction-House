# Happy-Auction-House
An online auction website emulating the functionality of eBay. 

## Background
This website allows the user to sign up as a seller or buyer, giving them capabilities to search, auction, and bid on items. As a database focused project, this demanded a good understanding of database concepts including database design, entity relationship modelling (cardinality & modality), database normalization, and SQL queries.
